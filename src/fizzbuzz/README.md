## Description
Print the number from 1 to 100 following these rules:
- if the number is divisible by 3 print 'Fizz'
- if the number is divisible by 5 print 'Buzz'
- if the number is divisible by 3 AND 5 print 'FizzBuzz'
- otherwise print the number as a string, eg: 1 -> '1'

### TODO (aka test list)
- What's the first test?
